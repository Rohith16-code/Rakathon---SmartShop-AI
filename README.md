# SmartShop AI

## About
SmartShop AI is a chatbot, which can assist consumers in deciding the right product and bridge the gap between online and offline shopping. 

## Features
- Suggests products to the consumer depending upon his needs, just like a salesperson.
- Helps the consumer to virtually experience fashion products. E.g. If a consumer needs to try a T-shirt or a spectacle our shopping assistant gives him real time experience of how that product would look on him/her.
- Provides a summary of all the reviews about a product, which prevents users from doing the tedious job of going through hundreds of reviews of that product.

# Instructions for running locally

## Initial steps
1. Install Docker by looking up the
   [docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

   at http://localhost:8000 and the API documentation would be available at http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Method II (Without docker)
### Running the Server

0. If you don't already have pipenv installed, install it using the following commands:
